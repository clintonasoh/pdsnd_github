### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, we use data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

This project was implemented and ran successfully in the Udacity workspace and my local Ubuntu 18.04 system. It runs perfectly on all properly setup python environments.

### Files used
- bikeshare.py
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

### Credits
- The credits for the creation of this project go to Udacity.
